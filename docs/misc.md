## `defer *http.Request.Body.Close()`

A request body does not need to be closed in the handler. From the http.Request documentation

```go
// The Server will close the request body. The ServeHTTP
// Handler does not need to.
```

## compare two slices

- Basic Case

```go
// Equal tells whether a and b contain the same elements.
// A nil argument is equivalent to an empty slice.
func Equal(a, b []int) bool {
    if len(a) != len(b) {
        return false
    }
    for i, v := range a {
        if v != b[i] {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```

- Optimized code for byte slices

```go
// To compare byte slices, use the optimized bytes.Equal. This function also treats nil arguments as equivalent to empty slices.
```

- General Purpose code for recursive comparison

For testing purposes, you may want to use reflect.DeepEqual. It compares two elements of any type recursively.

```go
var a []int = nil
var b []int = make([]int, 0)
fmt.Println(reflect.DeepEqual(a, b)) // false
```

The performance of this function is much worse than for the code above, but itâ€™s useful in test cases where simplicity and correctness are crucial. The semantics, however, are quite complicated.
